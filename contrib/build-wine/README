These scripts can be used for cross-compilation of Windows Shuttle executables from Linux/Wine.

Usage:
1. Copy content of this directory to /build-wine.
2. Install Wine (version 1.4 or 1.5+ works fine, 1.4.1 has bug).
3. Run "./prepare-wine.sh", it will download all dependencies. When you'll be asked, always leave default settings and press "Next >".
4. By running "./build-shuttle.sh", sources will be packed into three separate versions to dist/ directory:
  * Standalone compressed executable is "dist/shuttle.exe"
  * Uncompressed binaries are in "dist/shuttle". They're useful for comparsion with other builds.
  * NSIS-based installer of Shuttle is "shuttle-setup.exe"
7. Everytime you want to rebuild new version of Shuttle just change the path to ZIP file in "build-shuttle.sh" and re-run the script.
